Generating and Visualizing Synthetic Clusters with sklearn and pandas
Overview
This script demonstrates how to generate synthetic data using the make_blobs function from sklearn.datasets, create a DataFrame with the generated data using pandas, and visualize the data using pandas plotting capabilities.

Requirements
Python
scikit-learn library
pandas library
matplotlib library (for plotting)

Usage
Run the script in your Python environment. Ensure that you have the required libraries installed. The scatter plots will be displayed, showing the distribution of synthetic clusters.

This script can be used for educational purposes, to understand clustering algorithms, or as a base for further data manipulation and visualization projects.
